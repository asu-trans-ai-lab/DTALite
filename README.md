# DTALite

This repository maintains the source code and the Windows-based release for DTALite+NeXTA package. DTALite is an open-source Analysis, Modeling, and Simulation (AMS) library for efficiently macroscopic and mesoscopic traffic assignment based on [General Modeling Network Specification](https://github.com/zephyr-data-specs/GMNS) (GMNS) format. NeXTA is developed through the support of a [FHWA study](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/operations/13036/004.cfm) as a visualization tool for transportation AMS.

## Getting Started

1. [DTALite+NeXTA package](release/)
2. [Self-learning documents](docs/self_learning)
3. [User guide for NeXTA+QGIS using GMNS data format](docs/user_guide/1_QGIS_NEXTA_visualization_4_GMNS.md)
4. See [Path4GMNS](https://github.com/jdlph/Path4GMNS) for the Python implementation of DTALite along with the Python APIs to the portable DTALite running across Windows (x86_64), Linux (x86_64), and macOS (x86_64 and Apple Silicon).
5. See [TransOMS](https://github.com/jdlph/TransOMS) for the complete redesign and the enterprise-grade implementation of DTALite using Modern C++.

What is the best way to learn dynamic traffic simulation and network assignment
for a beginner? Do you want to integrate a powerful traffic simulator in your deep
learning framework? We would like to offer a collaborative learning experience
through 500 lines of Python codes and real-life data sets. This is part of our
mini-lessons through teaching dialog.
