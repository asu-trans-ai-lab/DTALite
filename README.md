(What is the best way to learn dynamic traffic simulation and network assignment for a beginner? Do you want to integrate a powerful traffic simulator in your deep learning framework? We would like to offer a collaborative learning experience through 500 lines of python codes and real-life data sets. This is part of our mini-lessons through teaching dialog.)
