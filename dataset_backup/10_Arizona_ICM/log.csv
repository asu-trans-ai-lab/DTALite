Step 1: Reading input data
Step 1.1: Reading section [demand_period] in setting.csv...
number of demand periods = 1
Step 1.2: Reading section [link_type] in setting.csv...
important: traffic_flow_code on link type 1 is 3
important: traffic_flow_code on link type 2 is 2
important: traffic_flow_code on link type 3 is 2
important: traffic_flow_code on link type 4 is 2
important: traffic_flow_code on link type 5 is 1
important: traffic_flow_code on link type 20 is 1
important: traffic_flow_code on link type 99 is 1
number of link types = 8
Step 1.3: Reading section [agent_type] in setting.csv...
number of agent typess = 1
Step 1.4: Reading node data in node.csv...
number of nodes = 30
Step 1.5: Initializing O-D zone vector...
number of zones = 2
Step 1.6: Reading link data in link.csv... 
Error: link_id  has been defined more than once. Please check link.csv.
number of links = 60
number of links =64
Step 1.7: Reading service arc in timing.csv...

Step 1.8: Reading file section [demand_file_list] in setting.csv...
number of timing records = 0

allocating 4D memory for 0 zones
allocating 3D memory for 0

Step 1.8: Reading file section [demand_file_list] in setting.csv...
o_zone_id:1, d_zone_id: 14, value = 10.000000
total_demand_volume is 10.000000

Step 2: Assigning computing tasks to memory blocks...
There are 2 networks in memory.

Step 3: Column Generation for Traffic Assignment...
