[PROCESS INFO] Validated subarea.csv. It contains 5 geometric points. Proceeding to FOCUSING analysis step.
[PROCESS INFO] Step 1.8: Preloading Origin-Destination (OD) demand data as part of the focusing approach. 
[DATA INFO] total pre-load demand = 7000
[DATA INFO] Initiating the first stage of the subarea scanning process, where we determine cut-off zones.
[DATA INFO] Total demand related to these zones : 7000.
[DATA INFO] Number of significant zones inside the subarea: 5. Total related demand inside significant zones: 7000.
[DATA INFO] Number of insignificant zones inside the subarea: 0. Total related demand inside insignificant zones: 0.
[DATA INFO] Ratio of total significant zone to  zones inside the subarea: 1.
[DATA INFO] Number of external zones related to the subarea: 0. Total demand related to the subarea from these external zones: 0.
[DATA INFO] Number of external zones related to the subarea with significant volume: 0.
[DATA INFO] During the second stage of cut off, the cut off zone includes all inside zones along with significant external related zones 
[DATA INFO] # cut-off zone size = 5,  total related demand from external cut-off  = 0
[DATA INFO] Cut-off volume threshold to determine significance = 0. External origin zones with a volume larger than this threshold will be retained.
[DATA INFO] Remaining external related demand percentage after the cut-off:  = 0 %
[DATA INFO] 0 zones are not significantly related to the subarea, accounting for 0 % of the total.
[DATA INFO] 5 zones are inside the subarea. 
[DATA INFO] Total demand = 14000. Subarea-related demand = 7000 (50%), accounting for 50% inside the subarea, i.e. 50 % outside the subarea.
[PROCESS INFO] Step 2.0: Reading file departure_time_profile.csv
[DATA INFO] At time 6:0 (T0600) , the demand ratio is 0.004343.
